#Rand click
- just clicks in a random tile

#Flag obvious
- find area where hidden tiles == numberOfAdjTiles
- flag all hidden tiles

#Afterflag
- find area where flag count == numberOfAdjTiles
- reveal all hidden tiles that are not flagged

#Traitor (by solving one of the fields other becomes broken)
- needs 2 UNSOLVED adj. fields
- one field contains all hidden cells of other field + its own hidden cells - #0
- if putting a mine in #0 solves the field, it's a traitor!

#I know where the others
- find two adjacent non-solved areas
- putting 1 flag in overlap "solves" t

#Count Matters
- if MEM == 0, just reveal all unflagged
- count NUM of areas(lacking 1??) that don't overlap (ignore revealed and flagged)
- reveal !areas
